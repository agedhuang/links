# Time Is Anything But Linear

A web experiment inspired by the idea that time is not always linear. In higher dimensions, past and future may coexist—so this interface lets you experience blocks of information in a way that feels random, non-linear, and a bit like seeing multiple moments at once.

## Concept & Design

- The grid is intentionally random and ever-changing, reflecting the uncertainty and complexity of time.
- The layout is calm, restrained, and document-like—serious, minimal, and focused on clarity.
- There is no timeline. Instead, every reload or shuffle gives you a new arrangement, as if past and future are shuffled together.

## Features

- Loads all blocks from the Are.na channel [time-is-anything-but-linear](https://www.are.na/amanda-guo/time-is-anything-but-linear)
- Each block (image, text, link, embed, file) appears at a random position and size
- Click any block to expand it fullscreen
- Hover (desktop) or scroll (mobile) to see the type of block in the center
- Shuffle button randomizes the layout
- Slider lets you adjust the grid column width

## Mobile

- Scroll to explore; the block type appears in the center as you move
- Tap any block to expand it fullscreen

## Built with

- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
